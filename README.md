## AI-Generated Portfolio Website from Resume — Streamlit + Gemini + LangChain

This project is an AI-powered portfolio website generator that converts a user’s resume / profile description into a complete, production-ready frontend website. Built using Streamlit and Gemini (via LangChain), the app dynamically generates fully-structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files based on the user’s prompt, packages them into a ZIP file, and allows instant download.

The application follows a structured website creation workflow — including a hero section, about section, skills, projects, and contact layout — while ensuring responsive design, clean styling, and meaningful content generation instead of placeholders. The generated files are automatically saved locally and bundled into a deployable website folder.
